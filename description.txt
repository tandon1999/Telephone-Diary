In “TELEPHONE DIRECTORY” we have done system design, source coding, and program testing and added many more features to facilitate the user with the best. We have given the user the facility to enter the person’s record and providing the option to save and delete that record and many more options.
The purpose of the project is to present the requirement of the computerization of “TELEPHONE DIARY MANAGEMENT”. The project thus manages the telephone details automatically it does almost every work which is related to automatic management of telephone billing via– new telephone detail, updating of detail, modification of detail, viewing customer record.
“TELEPHONE DIARY MANAGEMENT” is developed as per seeing the increasing culture. Thus, a new software has been proposed to reduce manually work, improving work efficiency, saving time and to provide greater flexibility and user friendliness. C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development: - Encapsulation, Data hiding, Inheritance, Polymorphism. We can improve the efficiency of the system, thus overcome the drawbacks of the existing system.
